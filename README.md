# Building A REST API in Rails 3

This app is the one built in this short screencast on [building a REST API in Rails 3 ](http://vimeo.com/user7965808/building-a-rest-api-in-rails-3 "building a REST API in Rails 3")

I've DRYed up the controller code a little more, the extra helper methods are 
more in line with the way I prefer to code.

Note, I've removed the references to the instance variables `@user` and `@users` in the views. Instead, they're accessed via helper methods!
